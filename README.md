# google-homepage

This repository carries a special significance, as it's my first official side project! Although it's nothing special, as the webpage has no functionality except some hover and focus effects which is done with css anyway, I found it extremely rewarding to do. I learned how to generally format html and css files, why to use a reset css file, how to use flexbox and much more. Recreating something that is connected to a company as big as Google is really cool. I hope you like it and the things that are to come!
